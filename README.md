# Advancing Chemical Structure Recognition in Hand-Drawn Images by AtomLenz (ATOM-Level ENtity localiZation)

AtomLenz is a chemical structure recognition tool providing atom-level localization, and can therefore segment the image into the different atoms and bonds. Our method operates by using a self-labeling strategy to generate atom-level annotations, enhancing the datasetâ€™s value, and using this enriched representation to fine-tune the model to a new domain.
